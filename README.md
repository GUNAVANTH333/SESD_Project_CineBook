# CineBook

A full-stack cinema ticket booking platform built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

CineBook lets users browse movies, select showtimes, pick seats, and pay — all in one flow. Admins manage movies, multiplexes, screens, and shows through a dedicated dashboard.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:--- |:--- |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, React Router v7 |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens), bcrypt |
| Validation | Zod |
| Icons | Lucide React |

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Application |
|:--- |:--- |
| Repository Pattern | All database access isolated in repository classes |
| Service Layer | Business logic decoupled from HTTP controllers |
| Adapter Pattern | PaymentGatewayAdapter wraps the simulated payment provider |
| State Pattern | BookingStateMachine enforces valid status transitions |
| Factory Pattern | SeatFactory instantiates the correct seat class from the DB seat type |

## OOP Principles

| Principle | Application |
|:--- |:--- |
| Encapsulation | Services own business rules; repositories own data access |
| Abstraction | Abstract Seat class; controllers never touch the database |
| Inheritance | StandardSeat, PremiumSeat, ReclinerSeat extend abstract Seat |
| Polymorphism | calculatePrice(basePrice) behaves differently per seat type |

---

## Features

### Customer
- Register and login with JWT authentication
- Browse movies with search and genre filter
- View showtimes grouped by movie and venue
- Interactive seat map with Standard, Premium, and Recliner tiers
- Live price calculation based on seat type and base price
- Payment via UPI, Card, Net Banking, or Wallet
- Cinema-ticket styled booking confirmation with receipt
- Full booking history with status tracking

### Admin
- Add and delete movies
- Add multiplexes and screens (seats auto-generated on screen creation)
- Schedule shows with automatic seat map generation
- Admin role granted at registration using the admin key

---

## Concurrency Handling

- Optimistic locking via a version field on ShowSeat rows
- TTL seat locks — seats locked for 10 minutes on selection, auto-released on expiry or cancellation
- Prisma transactions wrap seat locking and booking creation atomically

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- PostgreSQL database

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:5001`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`. API calls are proxied to port 5001 via Vite config.
